	<p><%= application.name %> is a place that tribal members can use to store, access, and share data.   It combines <a href="#uses/file-sharing">file sharing</a> with a <a href="#uses/social-networking">social network</a> and a variety of <a href="#apps">apps</a> so itâ€™s easy to view, manage and share data.</p>

	<h2><i class="fa fa-flag"></i>Sovereign Data Management</h2>
	<p><%= application.name %> is managed and controlled entirely by tribal members for tribal members.  There are a number of benefits to this approach: </p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<h3>Self-Reliance</h3>
			<p>Conventional data sharing approaches rely upon sharing platforms provided by the Tech Giants.  Using these platforms has made a large proportion of the population reliant upon these large corporations and subject to whatever terms they decide to impose.  We don't believe that this concentration of power is a healthy or sustainable practice. By running our own platform, we gain independence from the corporations that control so much of our modern digital lives.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Data Sovereignty</h3>
			<p>Using platforms provided by the tech giants limits the control that we have over managing our own data.  There's little to no transparecy over where the data is stored and it can be difficult to move data from these platforms so one becomes locked in to the platforms.  By running our own platform, we have control over our data. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Platform Control</h3>
			<p>Users of mainstream commodity platforms have no control over the platform itself.  If a user would like to make a change to how the software works, they are out of luck.  By building and running our own platform, we can craft it to suit the needs of our users. </p>
